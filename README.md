### About
Mango Maps is an all-in-one data aggregate of everything associated with locations, cities, and buildings displayed onto a map interface. It provides clean visualization of data fetched from various sources including Mapbox, Google Maps API, public government records, and etc. To keep things fun, we also implemented a disaster simulation tool that allows users to induce world ending disasters upon the earth! Want to drop a 15KT nuclear bomb on NYC? Go for it!
